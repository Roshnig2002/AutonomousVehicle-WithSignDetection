# AutonomousVehicle-WithSignDetection

This study proposes a novel integration of YOLOv8 for real-time traffic sign recognition and Deep Q-Network (DQN) for autonomous driving decision-making. YOLOv8
is employed to accurately detect traffic signs in the environment, specifically focusing
on their classification and localization. Concurrently, a DQN agent is trained in the
CARLA simulator environment to predict appropriate brake values based on the detected traffic signs, facilitating safe and efficient autonomous driving. The integration
leverages the strengths of YOLOv8’s fast and accurate object detection with DQN’s
ability to learn optimal control policies through reinforcement learning. Experimental
evaluations conducted in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in navigating complex urban environments while adhering to traffic
regulations. The results highlight the potential of the integrated system for real-world
applications in autonomous vehicles, contributing to advancements in both computer
vision and reinforcement learning for autonomous driving systems
